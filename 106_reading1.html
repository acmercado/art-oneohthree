			<h3> "Summarize the major elements of Chapter 1." </h3>
			<p> In the first chapter, “Cyborgs Unplugged,” of the book, Natural-Born Cyborgs: Minds, Technologies and the Future of Human Intelligence, the author, Andy Clark, states what is a “cyborg” and provides many examples that may classify as one. Some examples that were given are a rat with a Rose osmotic pump; people with cochlear implants; people with pacemakers; remote-controlled cockroaches; pets with microchips; and Professor Keven Warwick with an implant in his arm that would connect to his nerve fibers and send radio signals that would allow other electronic systems to react, such as opening doors and/or the turning off/on of lights. </p>
			<center>
				<p> . . . </p>
			</center>
			<p> While these examples may be the traditional definition of what a “cyborg” is, Clark also proposes that a “cyborg” can be living organisms without the penetration of an electronic device implemented into their bodies. He explains how humans and machines have been living side by side in a symbiotic relationship in which they help enhance our lives as we help understand and possibly enhance their lives as well (i.e. upgrades and newer models). The machine is a part of our everyday lives that it is as if one cannot live without the other. </p>
			<h3> "Summarize the distiction(s) from the traditional Kline and Clynes definition of 'cyborg' VS. the one that Clark is proposing as the main thesis of his book." </h3>
			<p> Manfred Clynes and Nathan Kline’s definition of a “cyborg” is subjected to any living thing that has an electronic component integrated into them. On the other hand, Clark challenges this definition with the idea that a “cyborg” can be a human without the implementation of an electronic device inside their body. For example, humans use technology (phones, laptops, and cars) in their everyday lives to go about their day. </p>
			<h3> "From the book, 'Cyberneticists were especially interested in self-regulating systems.' What are 2 or more examples of these? Make sure to include both biological and non-biological systems." </h3>
			<p> Some non-biological self-regulating systems that the book refers to are toilets and furnaces: After toilets are flushed, the ballcock in its tank drops and opens a valve that refills the bowl until the ballcock reaches a certain level of water which results in closing the valve. The temperature in furnaces rises to whatever temperature it has been set to, then stops operating once it reaches the set temperature. The book also refers to biological self-regulating systems such as those that reside in the human body: Every day, our bodies regulate the blood that pumps through our veins in our circulatory system and the oxygen we intake in our respiratory system to ensure that these systems aren’t . Our digestive system breaks down the food we eat into energy, but also makes sure to pass through our body so that it doesn’t get trapped within our system. </p>
			<h3> "What other kind of definitions of hybrid humans are there that are not based on the definitions above, but are popular in literature, media culture, etc.?" </h3>
			<p> The only “cyborgs” I can think of are Cable from the Marvel Comics Universe and Cyborg from the DC Comics Universe. They both are technically still fully human, with machinery to replace parts of their bodies. Cable’s bionic parts not only enhance his strength but also give him telekinetic capabilities. On the other hand, Cyborg’s bionic parts can transform into weapons, help him hack into external computers, take flight, and see at a superhuman level. In addition, he also has superhuman strength and speed. With these examples, the term “cyborg” not only has machines as a part of the human body but also enhances the human body to “superhuman” capabilities. </p>

			<h3> "Summarize the major elements of Chapter 2." </h3>
			<p> Chapter two, “Technologies to Bond With,” of the book, Natural-Born Cyborgs: Minds, Technologies and the Future of Human Intelligence, explains that there are two different types of technologies: transparent and opaque. While a line is drawn between these two categories, there are times when a technology is both transparent and opaque. Clark clarifies the differences between the two by using examples such as a PC, clock, pen and paper, and wearable computers. Clark also states how some technologies are not new inventions but modernized to be used easily. This becomes a central idea throughout the chapter as he explains that while we continue to make “new” technology, it takes training and practice to get a sense of each tool we choose to use. In other words, Clark reveals that while we may be advancing by creating opaque technology, we also improve them or adjust to the technology in ways that they become transparent to humans. This is where the line between the two is blurred whilst somewhat uniting the two as the same thing in different stages. </p>
			<h3> "Summarize the definition, as described in the book, of what the significant attributes are for 'opaque' technology and 'transparent' technology." </h3>
			<p> Clark states that transparent technology are tools that are well-fitted and integrated within our lives that they are almost seemingly “invisible.” In other words, they are tools that humans have no trouble with interacting with as if it is part of their everyday routine. In contrast, opaque technology are tools that may bring frustration to the user in which he/she needs to gain the skills and capacities to master them. In simpler terms, they are tools that humans are not naturally compatible with. </p>
			<h3> "Give some examples of technology that might be better served if it were more transparent and opaque." </h3>
			<p> Some examples of technology that I believe should be more transparent are cars and printers. I know how to use the two but if they break down, I do not know how to fix them. Upon opening the hood of my car, there are too many components to understand where the problem is being centralized. As for my printers, paper jams are an easy fix but ink mishaps and alignment issues are not my forte. As for technology that should be more opaque, I kind of wish my gaming consoles were so that my little brother can’t “accidentally” log onto my accounts and ruin my save files. </p>
			<h3> "Does the watch and dictionary example discussed in the book seem valid to you? Why?" </h3>
			<p> I agree that the concept of time is transparent because as the book states, time has been thought of with the rise of the sun and the moon. However, it is interesting that analog clocks may seem more opaque than digital clocks since analog clocks need to be hand-synchronised whereas digital clocks synchronize with themselves via their WiFi signal. On the other hand, the example of the dictionary may be transparent in the sense that words can be easily looked up on our devices, however, if one were to actually use a tangible dictionary, it may take a while for one to find the word buried in an abundant amount of pages with other words and their definitions. Yet somehow, the dictionary can still be “transparent” because we, as humans, know how to use it to navigate the word we are trying to define. </p>
