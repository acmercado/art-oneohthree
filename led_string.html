			<h3> description/process: </h3>
			<p> This project was meant to be an exercise for practicing my soldering connections. Since I am a beginner to soldering, the connections were not too great and I believe some of the individual wires from the flexible wires came out. It was definitely a challenge to have all of them connect, but they did nonetheless. </p>
			<center>
				<p> . . . </p>

			<p> I first made three LED strings as follows: wire, LED, wire, LED, wire, LED, resistor. To test if the LEDs were still working, I used the 9V battery to check them. In the next classes, we were shown how to make switches. Using the system diagram array from the LED calculator and the diagram that was created during class about including a switch, I was able to get a gist of how to connect the three LED strings together and how my LED string can operate without me holding it. </p>

			<p> To start the circuit, I placed a wire on the positive side of the 9V and another wire on the negative side. To make the wires conductive, I covered them with small pieces of aluminum foil making sure that they do not touch each other. To keep it in place, I at first used a popsicle stick and rubber band but I think my rubber band was too wornn out that it would come undone numerous times. I ended up settling for painter's tape to keep them in place. </p>

			<p> For the switch, I was going to use packing foam, aluminum foil, and wires but it did not look aesthetically please to me. Instead, I made my switch with a clothespin, wires, and copper tape. I first soldered wire to the copper tape twice and placed the tape on the side of the clothespin that was open. I made sure that the soldering parts were able to touch upon pressing on the clothespin. </p>

				<p> . . . </p>

			<p> Now that I had all of my pieces, it was time to connect it all together. As shown in the photos above, I soldered my three strands of LEDs together at both ends making sure there were the same polarities. I then connected the negative side of the strands to the negative side of the 9V. For the positive side, I connected it to one of the wires of my clothespin. To complete the entire circuit, I soldered the remaining wire of the clothespin to the positive side of the 9V. </p>

			<p> The project was pretty interesting and exciting since I am new to soldering. However, because I am a beginner as well, I feel like I still need to practice my joinery. As for decorating something with my LED strand, I was trying to put it on my actual cat but she did not appreciate the glowing lights surrounding her and possibly affecting her eyesight. In the end, I had to resort to my cat pillow instead. </p>
