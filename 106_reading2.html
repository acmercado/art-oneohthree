			<h3> "Summarize the major elements of Chapter 3." </h3>
			<p> This chapter explained how our brains work. It starts off by questioning whether we feel external tools become an extension of ourself. It then goes on to explain the meaning of "language" and how we use it to create ideas, thoughts, and concepts that could later be possibly materialized; how we obtain and learn new information; and how our brain is able to access knowledge whether they're inside our mind or are placed in the external world. It was also continuously mentioned that our brains are good at recognizing patterns, associating things to other things, modeling simple dynamics of the world, and manipulating objects in the environment. </p>
			<h3> "Explain your experiences where your senses have momentarily misled you or someone you know. Give examples." </h3>
			<p> Not sure if this is a correct example, but I think a time where my senses have momentarily misled me was when this colored dress went viral; At first I saw white and gold, but upon looking at it for a longer period of time, the colors changed to blue and black. Another example would be this one video that I've watched in which the sound seemed like it continuously got higher and higher, however, I know that IG (instagram) videos only last 30 seconds long, so it's impossible that it was gradually getting higher for about 3 minutes when the video was only 30 seconds long. </p>
			<h3> "What does the 'The Early Adopters Dream Technology' example on page 80 and the mangrove analogy starting on page 81 say about the role of language and its relationship to thought and meaning? Do you agree with the Authors assertion?" </h3>
			<p> The "Early Adopters Dream Technology" says that language is something easy to use and could be shared among a wide range of people. It also states that language can help us understand and create our own thoughts and strategies of concepts that already exist in the world or have not yet been created to better our world. However, it also argues that language could make some "lazy" since one can simply ask another for an answer. As for the "Mangrove Analogy," I believe that it says that language is something that can expand in different ways (the many branches); it could be shared among others (the fact that there are multiple individual trees, somehow connected); and it could help materialize the thoughts our brains conceptualize (the islands that form under each tree). I agree with these examples about language because it is something that allows us to understand one another, while it is also something that makes us different from each other in means of how we think and understand things. Branching off from the "Mangrove Analogy," our branches (ideas) may connect and be neat, but they are all differently contructed just as our islands (the ideas that materialze). I also agree with the "Early Adopters Dream Technology" that it could also make us lazy if we ask others for an answer to something, but I also believe that it would also depend such as if one doesn't truly understand something within our language that they need clarification from another.

			<h3> "The ideas of 'meta learning' (p. 67) and of 'constructive learning' (p.83) are brought up in this chapter. What do these 2 ideas have in common in terms of the process of learning and using information and memory? Please elaborate your thoughts on how you can 'learn' something from this." </h3>
			<p> The book states that "meta-knowledge" is "knowledge about how to acquire and exploit information" and "it is not knowing so much as knowing how to find out" (Clark). As for "constructive learning," the book states that it is "one whose own basic computational and representational resources alter and expand (or contact) as a system learns" (Clark). These two terms explain that knowledge is learned to help understand and/or gain information all while its memory is re-shaped to keep the newfound knowledge. Applying this to my own experiences, I would like to think that this is what my brain does every time I'm exposed to ideas that I never knew; I learn them and make room in my brain in order keep the information inside. </p>

			<h3> "Summarize the major elements of Chapter 4." </h3>
			<p> Chapter 4 explains the idea of telepresence: what it is, what are some examples (such as teleremotes, telerobotics, telemanipulators, and teleoperators), and how it relates to the human being a "cyborg." The book states that telepresence is about the relation of technology and the human body in ways that the technology may alter the human's perception of his/her surroundings. It also explains how there are examples that are on the verge of being identified as "telepresence" but are necessarily not quite it. The overall chapter explains how telepresence can me an extension of the self that can be abandoned or be used for a prolongued amount of time, and how new technology is constantly being created (meaning our sense of transparent technology may be even soon underway). </p>
			<h3> "What are the 2 main components of action that is required for Telepresence to exist and function properly?" </h3>
			<p> The 2 main components of action that required for telepresence to exist and function properly is that they must have a technological component that the human body can interact with, in which the tech may give multisensory feedback (such as sensory and visual) to the human to shift one's perspective. Telepresence in itself gives the sense of "bodily augmentation and extension" depending on the "timing and the nature of the signal exchanges that run between the biological brain, the human body, and the distant system" (Clark). </p>
			<h3> "What form of Telepresence do you think you have experienced? If you have not, what was the closest to it and what was missing for it to be not be 'telepresense'?" </h3>
			<p> I believe a form of telepresence I have experienced is "telemanipulator" or "teleremote" where I used a VR headset to play this game called "Job Simulator," and was "transported" to a mockup fast-food restaurant where I had to take orders and hand them out to my customers. It wasn't so much of a telepresence per se since I didn't "feel" like I was actually grabbing everything in game (I was using a controller to help me grab stuff), but it still distorted my surroundings to make me feel like I was actually in the mockup fast-food restaurant. </p>
			<h3> "Speculate on what other mechanics and sensory modalities that are based on Telepresence ideas, might be possible. What other ways can we be 'displaced' in their perception of where they are and what they can do? " </h3>
			<p> Considering my example of when I experienced "telepresence," I believe that through video games (and not just VR), we can be "displaced" in our perception of where we are. For example when we play a certain game for multiple hours on end without even realizing it, we've become immersed in the game's environment that we've forgotten the "real" world that our actual body takes place in. Another example could be "ASMR" videos; Personally, "hair brushing ASMR" makes it seem like someone else is brushing my hair as the sound effects seem so close while I'm wearing earbuds. (Without earbuds, some ASMR doesn't have the same effect of transporting you to a different place where you're being pampered).  </p>
