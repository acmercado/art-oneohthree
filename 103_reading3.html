			<h3> "From the podcast, how has your understanding of what dinosaurs really looked like evolved? Describe the progression of how we portrayed them and how might this affect our understanding of what Archeology says about them." </h3>
			<p> From the podcast, I feel like I know nothing about dinosaurs now other than the fact that some are herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores. We usually see/picture dinosaurs as these atheltic, terrifying, and huge reptiles but the podcast explains that since dinosaurs are essentially animals and their fat and skin is not preserved with their bones, it is very likely that dinosaurs can have "bizarre possibilities" of their appearances. The podcast gives an example that a dinosaur could have a hump like a camel but we would not know because their humps are not a part of their skeletal formation. This shows that archeologists from the past either are not smart enough to remember the key point of animal fat or that they did not bother informing the public of it since they have already shaped our view of what they looked like. It kind of makes me feel as if I have been lied to about dinosaurs and it also made me wonder why no one bothered to inform the public in a more widespread way about this. But given the fact that I feel like I have been "lied" to, it is probably a reason why they have not updated the information on dinosaurs (especially since there are endless possibilities of what they could actually look like). However, my weird though process has reminded me that science is always changing and evolving, so it would be fine for me to be told that "more information about dinosaurs" have been released and the headlines could be just as simple as that.
			</p>
			<h3> "The artist/archeologist, John Conway (who is doing interpretations of dinosaurs), is obviously taking liberty with what could be the actual truth of how these creatures existed. What other disciplines and forms of studies use similar techniques that reminds you of this method or process? Please elaborate with your examples both written as images and links." </h3>
			<p> John Conway's interpretations of dinosaurs reminds me of people who believe that the Earth is flat, except Conway's "theory" actually makes sense and seems like it has scientific evidence to back it up (the fossil that was found to have the outline of what the dinosaur looked like with tendrils like a porcupine). However, overall, it just reminds me of the idea of theories in general which means that these "truths" could be true but may not necessarily be true until they are scientifically proven -- (Conway's has been proven but needs more discoveries to show that dinosaurs have a wide range of "bizarre" appearances). </p>

			<p> *** UPDATED *** A similiar form od studies and/or techniques it is similar to are (3) how forensic scientists determine how someone might look like based on their bones. (4) how there are artworks of what Jesus and angels may look like without any knowledge of what they actually look like. (5) the "Telephone Art Challenge"??? - recreation of an artwork based on the speculation of the previous artwork.
			<h3> "First, summarize in your own words the characteristics of 'Material Speculation' as described in the second article. Next, given this article's shows examples for possible future products, how can this same technique also be used to create objects that refer to the past or current moment?" </h3>
			<p> According to "A Short Guide to Material Speculation: Actual Artifacts for Critical Inquiry," material speculation is the design of an object that is created to be used in the current day but also has elements of a "possible future" or a "possible world." </p>
			<center>
				<p> . . . </p>
			</center>
			<p> Considering that the object designs of material speculation often include "every day" technology with an aspect of the "future," to create objects that refer to the past would be like recreating an already-made object/an "ancient" technology but changing its appearance to fit the modern era. As for creating objects of the current moment, I think it would just be making every day objects with different designs. </p>
