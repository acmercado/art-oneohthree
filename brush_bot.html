			<h3> description/process: </h3>
			<p> The brush bot serves as our "first" soldering project. I believe my joinery still needs work, but it also somehow did get better. The entire circuitry of the brush bot from the class demo was kind of confusing, but using Lauren's photos from the Discord channel helped me a lot. </p>

			<p> Starting with the 3.3V battery, I soldered a wire onto copper tape twice and placed one of each on the positive and negative side of the battery. Using the wire from the positive side, I soldered the other end to the end pin of the switch that would turn the circuit on. With the remaining pins of the switch, I soldered another wire making sure those two pins were connected. I then connected the end of that wire to the positive side of a flashing LED light. On the negative side of the LED, I soldered a 220ohm resistor to it then connected that end piece to the wire that was attached to the negative side of the 3.3V battery. The vibe motor seemed like a "last minute" addition but I connected its red wire to the joinery of the LED to the switch, and its blue wire to the joinery of the resistor to the wire of the negative side of the 3.3V battery. </p>

			<p> Since my brush head was tiny, I wanted to make the wires short enough that my brush can withstand the weight of the circuitry ontop of it. However, because the wires were very short, it was extremely difficult to solder the wires together. Positioning the circuitry onto the brush head was awkward as well since I had to finesse "tiny" wires around for my brush's weight to be stablized. I ended up having some wires in the brush's bristles as it did not seem to have any effect on its movement. To keep the pieces in place, I used some painter's tape. </p>
