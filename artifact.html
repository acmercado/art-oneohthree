			<h3> How is This a "Cultural Artifact" ? </h3>
			<p> Personally, I consider the Gaming community a culture in which people who enjoy playing games, making/designing games, and critiquing games can all come together. We can enjoy games together through multiplayer games or simply converse about similar interests or dislikes about certain games. We can create relationships, fan art, cosplays, and other games within this community. </p>
			<center><p> . . . </p></center>
			<p> The Wii remote is an artifact as it is part of the Gaming community, specfically belonging to Nintendo's Wii console (which was released in 2006). The Wii remote a wireless controller with a power button, a D-Pad, an "A" button, "1" and "2" buttons, a Trigger button, a plus and minus button, and a Home button. It also has a sensor that controls the movement of the user's cursor on whichever monitor it is used on, a built-in speaker, and LEDs to determine which player number the user is. </p>
			<center><p> . . . </p></center>
			<p> Today, the Wii remote is replaced by Nintendo's newest console: The Switch (with their controllers called "Joy-Cons"). The Joy-con is often a pair of two controllers that could also be used individually. Nintendo revisits their old GameCube controllers in which they return the joysticks, the "XYAB" buttons, and L1/R1 and L2/R2 triggers. They can be used, connected to the console or not. Compared to the Joy-Con, the Wii remote seems like it was ahead of its time. I can also say that the new generation today doesn't even know what a Wii remote (or what a Wii console) is. </p>

			<h3> What if we had phones implanted in our arms? . . .  </h3>
			<p> - we'd probably have to charge ourselves (plug ourself and sleep to power it up). </p>
			<p> - we wouldn't be able to break or lose our phone anymore. </p>
			<p> - it'd be weird to hold our arm up to our ear (unless we would already be tapped into the audio to our ears). </p>

			<p> for this fusion model, i decided to go with the "arm phone" story. i'm not completely proud of how the hand turned out and i would like to add some "circuitry" textures, so for now, i would classify it as a rough draft. (in the bottle is supposed to be the arm phone, an ear piece, and a contact lens pair).</p>

			<h3> artist statement </h3>
			<p> the whole idea of the parts being in a jar is to make sense of them being "preserved" for an entire 3000 years. i decided to change the liquid color to purple because assuming that the arm was leaking blood, it would have mixed in with whatever blue solution kept it from deteriorating. instead of making the "phone" a body as well, i decided to upload an image of a phone screen onto the hand instead for a more "natural" look. i also thought it was a good idea to implent the idea of bluetooth ear pieces and contact lenses in order to have a more "outrageous-but-sensical" idea of the start of implanting technology into the human body. </p>

			<p> as one may know from my participation log, this project was difficult to complete on time because of my emotional state due to personal events. i wasn't sure (and honestly still am not) if i was doing this project correctly. however, i am quite proud of how the outcome of my (final) fusion model came out (even though the fingertips are not closed completely) and how my concept idea was able to come across to my viewers in my video. i am also content at the amount of hardwork i was able to pour into this project considering that i was unable to complete it with group members. </p>
