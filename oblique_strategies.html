			<p> Our group's oblique strategies were (1) face with a choice, do both; (2) emphasize differences; and (3) a very small, object, its center. We decided to go with our first oblique strategy -- face with a choice, do both -- as the main idea for all of our projects. For a sense of "cohesion" to our project as well, we decided to base our art on food with each of us being assigned to a specific meal time such as breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert. </p>

			<p> I was assigned to the meal-time, Dinner. My "face with a choice, do both" is the choice of having steak and mashed potatoes or shrimp. I would have added more shrimp but I had program difficulties when creating my art piece. </p>

			<h3> process: </h3>
			<p> I wanted to try a new program to make my art since I believed I wasn't that great at making realistic food in any type of medium that I knew. I stumbled across "Paint 3D" and tried it out by making random shapes at first. I ended up starting with a vase and flowers to get the hang of everything, then started on making the plate. I made my way in making each food component until the program completely crashed on me and I didn't have the file saved except for the screenshots that I had when I was showing my friend of my process. I then used the most recent screenshot in PhotoShop and used the brush tool to make some shadings and other details. The blank canvas in the background was bothering me that I decided to make it into a window with a picture I took a long time ago and a window pane png file. I also did some image adjustments to make all of the details pop more. </p>

			<h3> description/process: </h3>
			<p> During the start of quarantine, I wanted to revisit the "fun" artsy things I've done in High School and one of them was etching. I bought a pad of black scratchboard but did not want to invest in an etching pen that I used a steel nail to etch my image. I printed out a picture of a tiger, placed it on the scratchboard, and traced the picture on on top of it. Using different pressures and using the idea of space, I was able to make some "shadings" of the tiger. However, I messed up on the nose that I used a black permanent marker to fill it in then etch it out again. </p>

			<p> This sculpture is about 8 3/5 x 8 3/5 x 7 1/2 in. The entirety of this project is to represent the history of Filipinos in Stockton, CA but also represent my childhood of growing up in Stockton. On the plywood is a laser-etching of a geometric map layout of Downtown Stockton in which the hand poses as the Filipino Plaza building: one the last standing buildings that was a part of Little Manila, one of the biggest ethnoburbs for Filipinos. On the hand are photos of Filipinos harvesting asparagus, which is one of the things they were known for even though it created a stereotype for them. As for my personal experiences, my grandma used to take me to the market located inside the Filipino Plaza where I would buy my favorite cookies, meringues, and she would also bring me to pick up my grandpa from the asparagus farms. </p>

			<h3> description: </h3>
			<p> "UN-broken" tells a story about a girl who's insecurities about her "image" get to her head. She feels as if her weight is too much, that she's too short, and that she isn't pretty enough. Although on social media she appears happy with her life, behind the camera, she feels lost and trapped in her pessimistic world. She thinks everyone sees her insecurities as well and concludes that they all hate her for it. It isn't until the people she befriended tell her otherwise that she's beautiful no matter what she thinks. Her friends help her get out of the darkness she created, thus her accepting them as her new light. This video art is a reflection of how I felt about myself until I met friends that made me feel proud to be me and not matter about how I look. I wanted to show my experiences and how people can change one's thoughts on anything. It is the people that bring love to us and it is up to us to let them in and gladly accept their love.

			<h3> process/memorable moments: </h3>
			<p> All of the scenes were taken in one day, so it was quite interesting for my main character to do multiple wardrobe changes. She was tired of changing clothes that at one point she even said, "I bet this is how real actresses feel when they do multiple scenes in a day." During the projection-mapping scene, I felt bad since my subject had to look directly into the projector and at the light that we shone above her. The biggest "obstacle" about this short-film was the fact that I made this with friends and family members; it was difficult to film "the perfect shot" because they would often burst out into laughter causing me to laugh with them and us spiral into random convos. </p>
			<p> (I actually have a bloopers reel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff9EkoXes3c">here</a>. There would have been more clips but during most of our shenanigans, I did not press the "record" button). </p>
