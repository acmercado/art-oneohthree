			<h3> description: </h3>
			<p> After reading the article and watching the videos that were provided, I was set on making my Collaborative Machine a cat. I wanted my partner to be a pet that I would consider as my equal, although it was a bit of a challenge to think of ways a robotic cat can be in a mutualism relationship with a human; in what ways can a human benefit a robotic pet and vice versa? I was fine with just sticking with a commensalism relationship in which the cat would not benefit from the human but also would not be harmed in the process, but I thought more of the word “collaborative” and came to a conclusion that a commensalism relationship is not collaborative; It is as if one person does all the work in a group project while the other just slacks off. </p>
			<center><p> . . . </p></center>
			<p> At first, I envisioned my creation to support me in an apocalyptic era, similar to a sidekick. However, the more I thought about what my robotic cat would do, it just seemed like something that could possibly be made in the present day. The creation of this robotic cat was mainly due to the fact that I always drop and/or misplace my phone. I also thought about my cousin's Alexa and how she can only use it in one room of her house. The idea of having a moving phone and Alexa just seemed interesting to me and I wanted to build on it. </p>
			<center><p> . . . </p></center>
			<p> A “Day in the Life” with my robotic cat, ToMo, would be using her to play music, check the weather, make phone calls, send/receive emails and send/receive text messages. I would also use her as an alarm clock, timer, GPS and calculator. These are things I usually do on my phone in which I simply envisioned her to be a mobile version of an Apple watch mashed with an Alexa, or Siri, in the form of a pet. Her display would be touch-screen in case I do not want to use voice recognition to send emails and texts. Her tail would act as an antenna for cellular use, WiFi and GPS signals. The legs of ToMo could be interchangeable so that she has a mobile and an idle form. Her ports would include an audio and a USB port. </p>
			<center><p> . . . </p></center>
			<p> Some ways I thought could make our relationship a mutual collaboration is the fact that I need to charge her so that she may function throughout the day, possibly give her fuel if I were to use her in her mobile form, and give her software/hardware check-ups so she can function accordingly. I thought it would be find to just hook it up to a wall to charge it, but upon more brainstorms, I decided that it would be better if my way of charging it would be by taking it on walks and/or playing with it. As for the other ways to help the cat, fuel would act as its food and the check-ups would act as if I were taking it to a vet. In a sense, it would act like a phone but also like a pet. </p>
			<center><p> . . . </p></center>
			<p> Obviously, its weakness would be the fact that it needs maintenance to help it function. This is where I would come in to aid it to however way it sees fit. Its strength would be gathering "real-time" data from its signals to help me throughout my day but also help me know what is happening in the world outside of my house. This shows my "weakness" because I do not know everything in the world and ToMo would help me learn information that I would want to gather that day. </p>
			<h3> process: </h3>
			<p> I was able to conceptualize my idea by drawing my collaborative machine in PhotoShop using my 2-in-1 Dell Inspiron 15 7000 laptop. I used layers to differentiate the starting sketches to the final outlines and the different parts of the drawing. </p>
