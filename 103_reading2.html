			<h3> "What are the differences between site specific artwork and the idea of art interventions?" </h3>
			<p> Site-specific artwork is art that is created solely on the landscape/environment that make up the space as a whole in which it may stay in its space forever. They usually bring more focus to the environment in a way that enhances its surroundings or makes the viewers become more aware of the nature of the space, essentially leading them to appreciate the area. Art interventions are similar to "pop-up" arts in which they come out of no where for a short period of time. They are most often created for the world "outside of the art realm". These could be (but are not limited to) economic or political situations. They can be endorsed but those that are not, are argued among many about whether they are vandalism or not. </p>
			<h3> "What are the similarities and differences regarding the work of Walter de Maria and Banksy? Include your thoughts on their ideas of site specificness and interventions." </h3>
			<p> A similiarity I found between Walter de Maria and Banksy is the fact that their art serves to bring awareness to their viewers. For example, Walter de Maria's "Cricket Music," "Earth Room," and "Lightning Field" all give awareness to the Earth and makes its beauty of nature more prominent in artistic means. Banksy's art gives awareness to the ongoing problems of today such as animal cruelty, domestic abuse, paparazzi, etc.. A difference I found between the two artists is their style: Walter's pieces seem more simple, quiet, and calm whereas Banksy's pieces (although are simple in his spray paint works) can be complex, loud, and "in-your-face". A great example of what I mean when I say "in-your-face" is when Banksy had an animal truck carry animatronic animals (making crying sounds) and had it arrive in front of a butcher's shop. Clearly, another difference would be the fact that Walter de Maria does site-specific art and Banksy does art interventions. Walter takes into account of the area that his art would be placed such as in his "Lightning Field;" he took advantage of the area by making them kilometers long and evenly spaced, and he created his poles to be tall enough to be conductors of lightning but skinny enough that they do not completely obstruct the view of the landscape that they are in. Banksy's art mostly seem "out-of-the-blue" especially because he's mostly known to be like a "vigilante of art" whose identity remains a secret. Yet, his art still manages to get its point across with its abrupt revealing and short duration of show time (since they often arise as "vandalism" stunts). </p>
			<h3> "What are some of the most common creative tactics that all the 'signs' must share? What must a sign have to remain relevant? We are talking about signs that both in the practical context as well as signs that function as art." </h3>
			<p> Some common themes I found among "sign art" is the fact that they are either funny, inspirational, or dark (show the ugly truth of the world). A sign keeps its relevance by adhereing to pop culture and/or common world problems that are still present today (unfortunately). I think that these signs are able to serve as both practical context and art because signs are used everywhere to help people understand what's near them -- we look at signs for a sense of guidance -- and the sign's design is what many people notice at first glance; its visual representation is where the "art" perspective comes in, in which people could judge it or simply admire it in all its glory. </p>
			<p> *** UPDATE *** The common theme found among "sign art" is the fact that they are site specific: placed in an area that pertains to the environment its in. </p>
			<h3> "What kind of art, not shown here, have you seen that was made in response to its location, its environment, a specific event or situation? Please elaborate on its description, provide images if possible." </h3>
			<p> One place I remember seeing that was made in response to its location is this big painted sign on a wall in San Francisco that says "One Tree" and points to a big tree as well. It was created by Ricardo Gouveia (aka Rigo 23) in 1995 but unfortunately has been descerated in 2017. This piece may be seen as an art intervention as it seems random for it to be placed there, but it also could be seen as an site-specific art piece in which it was created to point at the tree that was already there. </p>

			<p> Another place I would like to mention is Salt Lake City, Utah's "You are Here" installation by Aaron T. Stephan in 2016. Although I have not been here in person, my cousin has recently shared some photos of this site through her Instagram story and thought it was a coincidence for an art piece like this to come up during the time that I am reading/learning about sign art. This piece also seems like a random art intervention, but it also could be site-specific for it is placed in front of the Salt Palace Convention Center, which makes great use for a tourist photo oportunity and shows others where they are. </p>
