			<h3> description/process: </h3>
			<p> The petra star was an interesting example to gain knowledge of how modulations and tesselations work. Tesselations could be created when patterns occur within the system and modulation is achievable when rearranging the pieces in multiple ways. </p>
			<center>
				<p> . . . </p>
			</center>
			<p> The first photo shows how the petra star was supposed to look, according to the video tutorial provided on the class website. Using the same shapes, it was kind of difficult to find different ways that the pieces could interlock in a secure way. I ended up making a "pinwheel" tesselation as one way to modulate them and a box in another way. I'm not entirely sure how I was able to make the two different pieces, but I know I got confused with all of the different folds along the way. </p>

			<h3> description/process: </h3>
			<p> For this part of the assignment, I was introduced to modulations and tesselations again but in a different approach. Starting with a triangle, I got to modulate the shape in multiple ways while following the directions from the video that was provided. I did not have any contruction paper or an x-acto knife to work with that I ended up making my triangular shape on Adobe's Illustrator. To make the tesselation, I would copy and paste the same shape and rotate them to make them fit with one another like a puzzle. It was difficult to piece some of them together because of the "Smart Guides" (which I had recently found out that they could be turned off), but I thought the design came out pretty nicely. </p>
			<center>
				<p> . . .
			</center>
			<p> As for the colors, I printed out my design then haphazardly colored in the shapes with some highlighting markers I had in my pencil case. I would have colored them on Illustrator, but it was fun to color them in like it was a page from a coloring book. </p>

			<p> I created 3 different fasteners for this phase. The first one uses a "slot, slit" fastener in which another member in my group has used. I then made another paper prototype of a fastener using a "tetris" -like shape (or jigsaw-puzzle-like). Out of pure curiosity, I made a third fastener that uses a piece of paper that would either be rolled up or take the shape of the "pins" shown in the photo above. Unfortunately, this fastener was fairly weak, so I did not continue it. </p>

			<p> for our group project, at first we came up with the idea of making animals. as we progressed through the assignment and created our shapes, we realized that we would essentially be creating monsters instead (especially with abstract limbs). we did not know how else to approach our documentation video except as an advertisement in which we came up with our final result. </p>

			<h3> thoughts: </h3>
			<p> the entire process of this project was very interesting and fun! thinking about different fasteners was the hardest part because our group was focused on using paper/cardstock since it was a material that was more accessible than the other choices. we learned (the hard way) that there are not many ways to join paper together (that isn't glue or tape). </p>
			<center><p> . . . </p></center>
			<p> once we settled on a fastener, it was just a matter of making different shapes that included it. we didn't really know where this project was going, so all of our pieces are very diverse. we sample cutted the fastener on cardstock and found that although our material is thicker than printer paper, our fastener was kind of flimsy. (kudos to eddson for thinking outside the box on how to make the fastener and how it can be revised to be more secure). </p>
			<center><p> . . . </p></center>
			<p> after the revision was tested, we felt like there needed to be a theme among our pieces now. however, since all of our shapes were so diverse, we didn't know how to tackle the question of "what is our theme?". after hearing the other groups' ideas, we thought we should make our theme as "animals." funny enough, our shapes were still diverse so our theme ended up becoming "monsters." </p>
			<center><p> . . . </p></center>
			<p> since we are in the month of october (spooky season), personally, i got excited for our project and how we were going to make our video and how we were going to assemble our pieces in general. </p>
			<center><p> . . . </p></center>
			<p> unfortunately, when assembly day came, i was unable to come into class physically with my group... my driver's license was still in the mail and people that i was able to contact for a ride were unavailable to provide a ride for me. however, i was still able to oversee how assembly and documentation went through a zoom meeting. </p>
			<center><p> . . . </p></center>
			<p> when creating our video, i was tasked on creating the audio and the script. making the script was sort of difficult for me since i was unsure what "look" my group was trying to go for. i thought an "advertisement" script would be easy enough, especially since we had to explain how our fastener works as well. honestly, i had many takes because i either couldn't read or i couldn't speak fast enough than my eyes. i wanted to use a voice mod as well to mask my actual voice, but i guess my voice is too high pitch that the "male" mods after recording didn't even sound like men. </p>
			<center><p> . . . </p></center>
			<p> overall, the experience of the project was very memorable and fun. i have my group members to thank for that. :) we were all very helpful when one of us had technical difficulties and we were all also open to any ideas to find "ground" within them. i enjoyed working with my group and couldn't have asked for a better team! <3 </p>
