			<h3> description/process: </h3>
			<p> The petra star was an interesting example to gain knowledge of how modulations and tesselations work. Tesselations could be created when patterns occur within the system and modulation is achievable when rearranging the pieces in multiple ways. </p>
			<center>
				<p> . . . </p>
			</center>
			<p> The first photo shows how the petra star was supposed to look, according to the video tutorial provided on the class website. Using the same shapes, it was kind of difficult to find different ways that the pieces could interlock in a secure way. I ended up making a "pinwheel" tesselation as one way to modulate them and a box in another way. I'm not entirely sure how I was able to make the two different pieces, but I know I got confused with all of the different folds along the way. </p>

			<p> Since I did not have any origami (or colored) paper, I ended up painting four pieces of printer paper with watercolors. After they have dried, I ripped them into square sizes and ripped them again (hotdog style) to fold them into the shapes the video tutorial had shown. </p>

			<h3> date: </h3>

			<h3> description/process: </h3>
			<p> For this part of the assignment, I was introduced to modulations and tesselations again but in a different approach. Starting with a triangle, I got to modulate the shape in multiple ways while following the directions from the video that was provided. I did not have any contruction paper or an x-acto knife to work with that I ended up making my triangular shape on Adobe's Illustrator. To make the tesselation, I would copy and paste the same shape and rotate them to make them fit with one another like a puzzle. It was difficult to piece some of them together because of the "Smart Guides" (which I had recently found out that they could be turned off), but I thought the design came out pretty nicely. </p>
			<center>
				<p> . . .
			</center>
			<p> As for the colors, I printed out my design then haphazardly colored in the shapes with some highlighting markers I had in my pencil case. I would have colored them on Illustrator, but it was fun to color them in like it was a page from a coloring book. </p>

			<p> As a group, we decided our main shape should be a triangle. Using the triangle, we made one side that would be used amongst all group members when making their own "shapes." We then shared our shapes amongst each other to create our own tesselations of our shapes combined. </p>

			<p> After making our own tesselations, we still came up with similar results of a hexagonal look. However, if they were unfinished or continuously added on top of the same shape, our end results made a more interesting and unpredictable tesselation. </p>

			<h3> description/process: </h3>
			<p> I created 3 different fasteners for this phase. The first one uses a "slot, slit" fastener in which another member in my group has used. I then made another paper prototype of a fastener using a "tetris" -like shape (or jigsaw-puzzle-like). Out of pure curiosity, I made a third fastener that uses a piece of paper that would either be rolled up or take the shape of the "pins" shown in the photo above. Unfortunately, this fastener was fairly weak, so I did not continue it. </p>
